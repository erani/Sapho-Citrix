# Pig Latin Task
 
**Write some Java code that translates a string (word, sentence, or paragraph) into “pig-latin” using the following rules.**
1. Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters “ay” added to the end.
*Hello becomes Ellohay*
2. Words that start with a vowel have the letters “way” added to the end.
*apple becomes appleway*
3. Words that end in “way” are not modified.
*stairway stays as stairway*
4. Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.
*can’t becomes antca’y*
*end. becomes endway.*
5. Hyphens are treated as two words
*this-thing becomes histay-hingtay*
6. Capitalization must remain in the same place.
*Beach becomes Eachbay*
*McCloud becomes CcLoudmay*
